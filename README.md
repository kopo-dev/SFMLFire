# SFMLFire
[C++][SFML] Forest Fire implementation

Usage: ./SFMLFire width height
Default: 800x800

Main ideas comes from here
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Forest_fire#C.2B.2B
I tweaked it so it degrade from Red to Black

I'd love to know how to make it run better on high resolution (maybe threading can help or else)
